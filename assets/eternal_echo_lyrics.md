# "Eternal Echo" - Original Lyrics in MGK "Twin Flame" Style

## Verse 1
Seven nights since I saw your silhouette
Against the skyline, stars in your eyes
You asked what I believed in
I said nothing, till I saw your smile
The universe conspired that night

## Pre-Chorus
First moment we locked eyes, you whispered
"We're eternal echoes from another time"
And tonight, the stars aligned
So take me somewhere we can disappear

## Chorus
I can't touch you yet, you're stardust
So I'll just breathe you in instead
My soul's exposed and fragile
'Cause I know you see right through me

You're too celestial for me
I'm too damaged to hold
I'm too lost, broken
I need you wholly

## Verse 2
Got seven ways to tell you that I
Fell into your gravity at first glance
I wish I could capture the way
You look at me like I'm your salvation

Rewind time, baby, stay
Maybe we met too late in this lifetime
Now I understand
Eternal echoes when I'm with you

## Chorus
You're too celestial for me
I'm too damaged to hold
I'm too lost, broken
I need you wholly
You're too celestial for me
I'm too damaged to hold
I'm too lost, broken
I need you wholly

## Bridge
I feel like we should just leave here and
(Where would we go?)
You and I could just vanish somewhere, just disappear
(In this life I know) (I feel you)
(There's no perfect endings) I feel you
(In this life I know)
(There's no perfect endings)

## Outro
Close your eyes
I'll find you in the afterlife
This changes everything
Now I have to let you go
